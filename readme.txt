Quotes can be philosophical, humorous, famous or just about everything imbetween. They are picked at random from twelve different quotes, which themselves are updated every 24 hours.

1. Put the qqotd.php file into your wp-content/plugins directory.

3. Insert <?php do_qquotes(); ?> into one of your templates (header.php is recommended).

This plugin allows you to easily display quality random quotes on your blog.

To display the tag grid in your page add:
<?php do_qquotes(); ?>

It is designed to be placed in the header.
